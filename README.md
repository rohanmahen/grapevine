# grapevine

Welcome to the official repository for Grapevine, now open-sourced after two years on the shelf. Grapevine is a community-focused app that connects university students with local events and the groups attending. It was developed as a part of my 2nd year at KCL with
the help of a few friends. The app was released on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store and topped out around 300 MAU.

Check out Grapevine on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.grapevineapp.grapevine&hl=en&gl=US).

### Open Sourcing Grapevine

By open-sourcing Grapevine, I aim to:

- Finally put out the code that I've been sitting on for two years.
- Provide a resource for students looking to build a similar app.

If you want to contact me about it or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on twitter at [@mahendrakerr](https://twitter.com/mahendrakerr).
