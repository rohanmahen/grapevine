Welcome to the official repository for Grapevine, now open-sourced after two years on the shelf. Grapevine is a community-focused app that connects university students with local events and the groups attending. It was developed in my spare time during my 2nd year at KCL with the help of Leo Djunbushian. The app was released on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store and topped out around 300 MAU.

Check out Grapevine on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.grapevineapp.grapevine&hl=en&gl=US).

### Open Sourcing Grapevine

By open-sourcing Grapevine, I aim to:

- Finally put out the code that I've been sitting on for two years.
- Provide a resource for students looking to build a similar app.
- Help you avoid tarpit ideas like this one. Here's a YC video on [tarpit ideas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMIawSAygO4).

If you want to contact me about it or have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on twitter at [@mahendrakerr](https://twitter.com/mahendrakerr).
